Some of those aren't the first time i mention them, so i'm leaving it here now
Iteration 2:
- Remove Interaction Diagram SD Book a trip
>> only content is "TO DO"
- Interaction SD Diagram- Booking Trips create_reservation().drawio.png
>> t:Trip gets an addReservation(r) that hasn't received a return nor been called by another function
- Use Case Diagram-user logic.png
>> remove Console ("main") Controller from actors, that thing is part of system
- Use Case Model Book a Trip Iteration2.png
>> same as previous, remove console from actors, also the image is glitched for me
- Use Case Model Trips-Interaction SD diagram create a booking.drawio.png
>> duplicate with > Interaction SD Diagram- Booking Trips create_reservation().drawio.png?
