Some of those aren't the first time i mention them, so i'm leaving it here now
Not sure if we bother with changing past diagrams?

Iteration 2:
- Remove Interaction Diagram SD Book a trip
>> only content is "TO DO"
- Interaction SD Diagram- Booking Trips create_reservation().drawio.png
>> t:Trip gets an addReservation(r) that hasn't received a return from anything in reservation
nor been called by another function
- Use Case Diagram-user logic.png
>> remove Console ("main") Controller from actors, that thing is part of system
- Use Case Model Book a Trip Iteration2.png
>> same as previous, remove console from actors, also the image is glitched for me
- Use Case Model Trips-Interaction SD diagram create a booking.drawio.png
>> duplicate with > Interaction SD Diagram- Booking Trips create_reservation().drawio.png?

Iteration 3:
- DataDomainModel.drawio.png
>> seems to be the unupdated version of > Relational Data Model.drawio (1).png
>> and by the way, where is the "foreign key"(definitely not the primary key) of route_id in
connections used? ive asked multiple times what is up with generating a random number to
serve as id, someone answer please. maybe also tell me how the current goes from present to
past trip too
- Use Case Book a Trip ite3.drawio.png
>> remove console from actor list
