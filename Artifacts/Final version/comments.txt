Some of those aren't the first time i mention them, so i'm leaving it here now
Not sure if we bother with changing past diagrams?

very tabbed lines == done

Iteration 2:
            - Remove Interaction Diagram SD Book a trip
            >> only content is "TO DO"
- Interaction SD Diagram- Booking Trips create_reservation().drawio.png
>> t:Trip gets an addReservation(r) that hasn't received a return from anything in 
reservation nor been called by another function
- Use Case Diagram-user logic.png
>> remove Console ("main") Controller from actors, that thing is part of system
- Use Case Model Book a Trip Iteration2.png
>> same as previous, remove console from actors, also the image is glitched for me
- Use Case Model Trips-Interaction SD diagram create a booking.drawio.png
>> duplicate with > Interaction SD Diagram- Booking Trips create_reservation().drawio.png?

TODO: searchForConnections SD

Iteration 3:
- DataDomainModel.drawio.png
>> seems to be the unupdated version of > Relational Data Model.drawio (1).png
>> and by the way, where is the primary key of route_id used in?
connections used? ive asked multiple times what is up with generating a random number to
serve as id, someone answer please. maybe also tell me how the "current" parameter in 
reservation goes from present to past trip too
- Use Case Book a Trip ite3.drawio.png
>> remove console from actor list

Iteration 4:
- A folder called previous artifacts
>> but it only has an empty file called UML

TODO: parse... code base..........

- data domain model does not make sense now
>> reservation contains user information while it has an association class for ticket
>> would make more sense if ticket representated an instance of reservation, and reservation becomes an association class between user and trip
>> should results not be connected to trips? what makes up the trip? it's definitely not reservations...
...........
- interaction sd diagram create a booking, you need to return the r to trip before trip self adds it, otherwise where does the r come from
- idk whats a relational data model, will search, but current one is based off data domain model so there's definitely something wrong...
>> looked at slides 15, what. ite 4 doesnt mention, went to ite 3 description, is this the "document this provision with a Data Model (Tables) while clearly identifying any and all keys"?
