## Project Description

Trainz is a system built to help users better plan their train travels!
This system enables our clients to search and book possible trips by duration and price to ensure that our clients can better plan their train trips thanks to our system's built-in filtering search functionality.

## How to Run

This project is console-based: it is only necessary to run main.py
*Our code can be found under the **Trainz** folder
